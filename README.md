This is a restaurant website project I made during my course in a coding school. It is made using vanilla javascript and consists of three main pages: home, order and booking. The website allows you to make orders as well as book tables if they are currently not reserved for upcoming events. The page is finished and is hosted on Netlify for preview: https://project-pizzeria.netlify.app
